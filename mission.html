                    <h2>The Critical Need</h2>
                    <p>Traditional fire suppression systems—sprinklers and alarms—are reactive. They often engage only after significant smoke or heat has already compromised a structure. This delay results in billions of dollars in property damage and irreparable loss of life every year.</p>
                    <p>Industrial environments and high-density business sectors require a solution that doesn't just alert, but actively intervenes before a spark becomes a catastrophe.</p>
